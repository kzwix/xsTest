To compile the test library:

	make -f makefile fc.so


To compile the C program testing that the test shared library "works as intended":

	make -f makefile tex


To execute the C test program:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tex

(It shouldn't find the library, because it is not in the usual library search path.
Now, type "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=." - while in the project directory, then try again.
This time, the program should work as intended, and display beautiful lines on stdout...)



Now, the XS part:

To create the xs directory tree, simply use:

	make -f makefile xsInit

It should call x2xs to create the module directory tree, then replace the Makefile.PL and xsModule.xs files with the ones in the project root.
The next step would be to go to the xsModule directory, to run the "standard" build steps:

	perl Makefile.pl

(which will generate a Makefile from the Makefile.PL)

	make				(will generate the module files, including xsModule.pm and xsModule.so, which will contain the C glue)
	sudo make install	(will copy the module's contentents to your system directories)
