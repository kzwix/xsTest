To compile the test library:

	make -f makefile fc.so


To compile the C program testing that the test shared library "works as intended":

	make -f makefile tex


To execute the C test program:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tex

(It shouldn't find the library, because it is not in the usual library search path.
Now, type "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=." - while in the project directory, then try again.
This time, the program should work as intended, and display beautiful lines on stdout...)



Now, the XS part:

To create the xs directory tree, simply use:

	make -f makefile xsInit

The next step would be to go to the xsModule directory, to run the "standard" build steps:

	perl Makefile.PL

(which will generate a Makefile from the Makefile.PL)

	make				(will generate the module files, including xsModule.pm and xsModule.so, which will contain the C glue)

	perl test_module.pl		(tests that the module works)

sudo make install	(will copy the module's contentents to your system directories)
